Mockup photography website built without BootStrap.

Responsive website designed without any frameworks. 

Recently revamped the entire website and fixed multiple issues with it. Got jQuery lightbox to
work with CSS grid. The problem was fixed be switching the ID selector from the <img> element to
the <a> element. Very simple fix and now lightbox works properly with CSS grid.

Used CSS grid for the layout of the images. Flexbox used in about me page. 

JavaScript used to make mobile navbar. Fixed the navbar to look better. Currently, the only thing 
I would want to add is a smooth transition when you click on the mobile navbar. Fixed the JavaScript
to include an exit icon after you click to expand the mobile navbar.

Any bugs or recommendations for me to make this project better? Let me know!
