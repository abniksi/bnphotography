Mockup photography website built without BootStrap.

Responsive website designed without any frameworks. 

Recently revamped the entire website and fixed multiple issues with it. Got jQuery lightbox to
work with CSS grid. The problem was fixed be switching the ID selector from the <img> element to
the <a> element. Very simple fix and now lightbox works properly with CSS grid.

Used CSS grid for the layout of the images. Flexbox used in about me page. 

JavaScript used to make mobile navbar. Working to add more JavaScript elements to the website. 
Trying to make the navbar much better. Mobile navbar is the only thing I am not happy with 
currently with this project.

Any bugs or recommendations for me? Let me know!
