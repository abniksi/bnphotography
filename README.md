Photography website built for a friend.

Responsive website designed without any frameworks. 

Tried using jQuery lightbox so user could click on the photos and see full image. Light box was messing up the CSS grid layout I was using so I scrapped it. Currently looking into how to solve this problem.

Used CSS grid for the layout of the images. Flexbox used in about me page. 

JavaScript used to make mobile navbar. Working to add more JavaScript elements to the website. 

Any bugs or recommendations for me? Let me know!
